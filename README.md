# Pokermon
This is a fork containing my own personal tweaks to the Balatro mod [Pokermon](https://github.com/InertSteak/Pokermon)

## List of changes
- Pidgeot gives planet of the highest leveled hand.
- Mew percent chance increased to 80%
- Gastly evo line will only target jokers without an edition
- Crobat can't give stone cards
- Porygon-Z energy gen effect gives matching energy to leftmost joker.
- Lower Deino line's evo reqs; Deino 6 triggers, Zwei 8 triggers.
- Espeon rank select based on deck. Not suit select though.
- Revert Togekiss nerf

## Things I may do later.
- Change Articuno to give a random edtion(excluding shiny & negative)
- Allow Umbreon to delevel a hand to 0 and below, if that's possible.
- Give Sylveon to more variety of tags such as ethereal tag.
- Considering Flareon's reducing reroll req to gain xmult to 2. 
- Increase megastone's soul rate.
- Change +Hand and +Discard jokers to +Hand/Discard on blind select.
