# Pokermon
This is a fork containing my own personal tweaks to the Balatro mod [Pokermon](https://github.com/InertSteak/Pokermon)

## List of changes
- Mew percent chance increased to 80%
- Gastly evo line will only target jokers without an edition
- Adjusted Gengar's round timer probabilities
- Crobat can't give stone cards
- Porygon-Z energy gen effect gives matching energy to leftmost joker.
- Lower Deino line's evo reqs; Deino 6 triggers, Zwei 8 triggers.
- Togekiss + odds from 1 to 2
- Hazard break chance from 1/6 to 1/8
- Lucario xmult from 1.3x to 1.4x
- Adjusted edition weights for when Scizor gains an edition
- Buff Espeon's xmult to 1.3x

## Things I may do later.
- Change Articuno to give a random edtion(excluding shiny & negative)
- Allow Umbreon to delevel a hand to 0 and below, if that's possible.
- Increase megastone's soul rate.
- Change +Hand and +Discard jokers to +Hand/Discard on blind select.
